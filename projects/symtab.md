# Building a symbol table for TypeScript
## Goal

## Discussion

### Building and testing

The build assumes Java 8.

I suggest that you use Intellij, which knows how to deal with maven (`mvn`) builds. You can run the unit tests with a simple click. It should work on UNIX (including Mac) and Windows.

From the command line, you can build and store a jar with all of your software as follows on UNIX:

```bash
$ mvn install
```

## Deliverables

## Submission

You must submit your project via github using your account and the repository I've created for you in organization [USF-CS345-S16](https://github.com/USF-CS345-S16).

You are required to show git commits to your repository that are consistent with developing the software for this project.
