# Building a symbol table for TypeScript

## Goal

You will build a grammar for a subset of [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) (JavaScript with static types) and then populate a symbol table with classes, functions, and variable definitions.

## Discussion

## Getting started

I have provided a [starter kit](https://github.com/USF-CS345-starterkits/parrt-symtab) that you can pull into your repository.

You can get any updates to the starter kit by simply `git pull`ing again from `USF-CS345-starterkits/parrt-symtab.git`.

## Building and testing

The build assumes Java 8.

I suggest that you use Intellij, which knows how to deal with maven (`mvn`) builds. You can run the unit tests with a simple click. It should work on UNIX (including Mac) and Windows.

From the command line, you can build and store a jar with all of your software as follows on UNIX:

```bash
$ mvn install
```

## Deliverables

## Submission

You must submit your project via github using your account and the repository I've created for you in organization [USF-CS345-S16](https://github.com/USF-CS345-S16).

You are required to show git commits to your repository that are consistent with developing the software for this project.
