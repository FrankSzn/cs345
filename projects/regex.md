# Recognizing regular expressions
## Goal

## Discussion

## Getting started

I have provided a [starter kit](https://github.com/USF-CS345-starterkits/parrt-regex) that you can pull into your repository. From the command line, it looks like:

```bash
$ cd userid-regex # jump into dir containing your empty repo
$ git pull git@github.com:USF-CS345-starterkits/parrt-regex.git master
```

## Building and testing

The build assumes Java 8.

I suggest that you use Intellij, which knows how to deal with maven (`mvn`) builds. You can run the unit tests with a simple click. It should work on UNIX (including Mac) and Windows.

From the command line, you can build and store a jar with all of your software as follows on UNIX:

```bash
$ mvn install
```

## Deliverables

## Submission

You must submit your project via github using your account and the repository I've created for you in organization [USF-CS345-S16](https://github.com/USF-CS345-S16).

You are required to show git commits to your repository that are consistent with developing the software for this project.
