## Submission

You must submit your project via github using your account and the repository I've created for you in organization [USF-CS345-S16](https://github.com/USF-CS345-S16).
 You are required to show git commits to your repository that are consistent with developing the software for this project. For example, a single large commit of the entire project at once could be considered circumstantial evidence for academic dishonesty.
